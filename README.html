<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This language is an <em>a priori</em> language in which <strong>word roots are randomly generated using dice</strong>.</p>
<p>For each syllable in a new root:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Standard_variations">D12</a> is rolled to determine the initial consonant:<br />
1=b, 2=d, 3=f, 4=g, 5=k, 6=l, 7=m, 8=n, 9=p, 10=s, 11=t, 12=x</p></li>
<li><p>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Standard_variations">D6</a> is rolled to determine the vowel:<br />
1=a, 2=a, 3=e, 4=i, 5=o, 6=u</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The creation of new word roots is predominantly random by means of dice rolls as shown above. However, a randomly rolled word root can be rejected if for some reason inherent to the language it would be likely to cause problems. In that case the entire word root is rolled again.</p>
<p><strong>Not all word roots are randomly generated.</strong> Exceptions include: proper nouns; words derived from international symbolic notations (such as the unit symbols of the International System of Units, and the symbols for chemical elements in the periodic table); words whose invented form is inherently likely to be easier phonetically, mnemonically, sequentially or logically.</p>
<p>The name of the language, <em>Nuda</em>, was the result of the first four dice rolls in the construction of the language.</p>
<p>The language shall have a <strong>very small, strict grammar</strong>.</p>
<p>The size of the <strong>vocabulary is unlimited</strong> but compounding of existing roots shall be preferred over creating new roots.</p>
<p>Spelling, pronunciation and grammar shall be <strong>simple and easy</strong>.</p>
<p>The language is intended to be <strong>fun and practical</strong>. It is not intended to rival natural languages in power. Rather, it is intended to be self-contained such that at each step of its development it is fun and practical to use within its current scope of development.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<h3 id="why-a-priori">Why <em>a priori</em>?</h3>
<p>Most modern auxlangs are <em>a posteriori</em> in the sense that their word roots are taken from existing natural languages. Nuda is an <em>a priori</em> language whose word roots are randomly generated by rolling dice. The principal reasons for this design decision were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Several well-developed and reasonably well-known <em>a posteriori</em> auxlangs are already available (Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, Occidental, Lingua Franca Nova, Lingwa de Planeta). However, for passive literary use in reading sophisticated works of literature, Robert Winter, whose native language is English, found all of these languages to be far more difficult than French. This unexpected conclusion was reached after a few years of intermittent study of these auxlangs and of French. A major factor was that the resources available to assist the student of French were far superior to the resources available for any of the auxlangs. And although it was easier for Robert Winter to write simplistic sentences in the auxlangs than in French, the only auxlang he nearly always found to be easier than French for writing sophisticated sentences without assistance from another person was Interlingua, since it was possible to extrapolate from natural Romance languages to Interlingua when composing sophisticated sentences. However, Interlingua remained far more difficult than French for reading sophisticated works of literature. If a native speaker of English finds that French, although very difficult, is easier to learn to read in depth than any of these <em>a posteriori</em> auxlangs, despite their familiar vocabulary, it is even more likely that a native speaker of Chinese, to whom their vocabulary is unfamiliar, would reach the same conclusion. In short, the use of <em>a posteriori</em> vocabulary as the basis of an auxlang typically brings with it such difficulty (in idioms, grammar, word formation, pronunciation, phonotactics and spelling) that the auxlang is then unable to compete (even on the basis of ease alone) with the natural languages from which its vocabulary is sourced and for which better resources are available to support the student.</p></li>
<li><p>As a thought experiment, an <em>a posteriori</em> auxlang was imagined whose vocabulary was predominantly Chinese and therefore unfamiliar to an English speaker. Almost certainly such an auxlang would have difficulties in idioms, grammar, word formation, pronunciation, phonotactics and spelling as a result of its vocabulary being predominantly Chinese. For the reasons given above, the reality is that if an English-speaking student needed to use Chinese vocabulary he or she would soon reject learning such an auxlang in favour of learning Chinese, because given the far greater resources available for learning Chinese (using pinyin) it would actually be the easier path. This is even without considering the economic advantages of learning Chinese.</p></li>
<li><p>As a thought experiment, another auxlang was imagined, also intended to be accessible to speakers of English and to speakers of Chinese, but which used neither English vocabulary nor Chinese vocabulary. Its vocabulary would be entirely <em>a priori</em> and would be designed to be reasonably mnemonic to assist its memorization. Such an auxlang would not need to inherit any difficulties from either English or Chinese with respect to idioms, grammar, word formation, pronunciation, phonotactics and spelling but could instead be designed to be internally consistent. For example, it could have exceedingly easy pronunciation, phonotactics and spelling, unconstrained by any need to be capable of importing words from Chinese or English. In theory, if such a language were designed well enough to be fun and practical to use at least for some limited purposes, it could prosper because it could truly be easier than natural languages for those limited purposes. This thought experiment demonstrated the advantages of <em>a priori</em> vocabulary.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible that these conclusions are incorrect. If that is the case then happily some <em>a posteriori</em> auxlangs might become more successful in future. However, Robert Winter has chosen to focus his efforts on <em>a priori</em> auxlangs for the reasons given above.</p></li>

<h2 id="phonology">Phonology</h2>
<p>Almost one letter, one phoneme. The exceptions are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>optionally, <strong>a</strong> can weaken from /a/ to /É/ when unstressed</li>
<li>occasionally, <strong>k</strong> can be pronounced /kw/ to emphasize that it is not <strong>g</strong></li>
<li>occasionally, <strong>p</strong> can be pronounced /pw/ to emphasize that it is not <strong>b</strong></li>
<li>occasionally, <strong>t</strong> can be pronounced /tw/ to emphasize that it is not <strong>d</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a</strong> â /a/ <code>(optionally /É/ when unstressed)</code></li>
<li><strong>b</strong> = /b/</li>
<li><strong>d</strong> = /d/</li>
<li><strong>e</strong> â /e/</li>
<li><strong>f</strong> = /f/</li>
<li><strong>g</strong> = /g/</li>
<li><strong>i</strong> â /i/</li>
<li><strong>k</strong> = /k/ <code>(optionally /kw/)</code></li>
<li><strong>l</strong> = /l/</li>
<li><strong>m</strong> = /m/</li>
<li><strong>n</strong> = /n/</li>
<li><strong>o</strong> â /o/</li>
<li><strong>p</strong> = /p/ <code>(optionally /pw/)</code></li>
<li><strong>s</strong> = /s/</li>
<li><strong>t</strong> = /t/ <code>(optionally /tw/)</code></li>
<li><strong>u</strong> â /u/</li>
<li><strong>x</strong> â /Ê/</li>
</ul>
<p>That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consonants (C): <strong>b d f g k l m n p s t x</strong></li>
<li>Vowels (V): <strong>a e i u o</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Syllable structure is:</p>
<ul>
<li>CV</li>
</ul>
<p>Unused letters:</p>
<ul>
<li>c h j q r v w y z</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stress">Stress</h3>
<p>The penultimate syllable is normally the stressed syllable in all polysyllabic words. However, the speaker is welcome to shift stress to some other syllable for clarity or emphasis when doing so would facilitate communication.</p>

<h2 id="the-nuda-clock">The Nuda Clock</h2>
<p>The Nuda clock is a mnemonic device from which important core vocabulary of the Nuda language is derived. It is based on the order of the 12 consonants of the Nuda alphabet, combined with the order of the 5 vowels of the Nuda alphabet, geometrically applied to a clock face and also associated with colours and times of day.</p>
<p>Nuda is not a philosophical language; it is not based upon classifications. It is in part a mnemonic language and in part a randomly generated language. When being used mnemonically, the 13 syllables shown on the Nuda clock variously have associations such as colour, position, direction, time and number. They can also be combined, such as to signify geospatial relationships and mathematical operations. The Nuda clock is the key to memorizing important core vocabulary. It is a simple <em>aide-mÃ©moire</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Start the list with the delimiter <strong>(</strong> which is pronounced <strong>do</strong></li>
<li>If the list has more than 1 element, precede the last element with <strong>na</strong></li>
<li>If the list has more than 2 elements, separate other elements with the delimiter <strong>,</strong> which is also pronounced <strong>na</strong></li>
<li>End the list with the delimiter <strong>)</strong> which is pronounced <strong>sa</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In colloquial speech you can choose not to pronounce these delimiters, instead only pronouncing each of the actual list elements themselves and the <strong>na</strong> preceding the last element. In formal speech all delimiters are pronounced.</p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<p>A list with 3 elements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1, 2 na 3) = (bana, dena na fina)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a list has more than one element, the last element in the list must be preceded by the special delimiter <strong>na</strong> and this must be pronounced, even in colloquial speech. In formal speech each comma is also pronounced <strong>na</strong>.</p>
<p>Pronunciation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formal speech: &quot;do bana na dena na fina sa&quot;<br />
Colloquial speech: &quot;bana, dena na fina&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may pause slightly at the opening parenthesis of a list, at each comma in a list, and at the closing parenthesis of a list, to emphasize that you are enunciating the elements of a list.</p>
<p>A list with 1 element:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) = (bana)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pronunciation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formal speech: &quot;do bana sa&quot;<br />
Colloquial speech: &quot;bana&quot;</p>

<h3 id="s3.-singular-demonstratives">s3. Singular demonstratives</h3>
<h4 id="scope-2">Scope</h4>
<p>To be able to refer to something using a demonstrative pronoun.</p>
<h4 id="means-2">Means</h4>
<p>To declare a demonstrative, add suffix <strong>ki</strong> to clock syllable: 0th=xaki, 1st=baki, 2nd=deki, 3rd=fiki, 4th=goki, 5th=kuki, 6th=laki, 7th=meki, 8th=niki, 9th=poki, 10th=suki, 11th=taki, 12th=xeki. These are known as 'declaratives' (short for 'declarative pronouns').</p>
<p>To reference a previously declared demonstrative, add suffix <strong>ko</strong> to clock syllable: 0th=xako, 1st=bako, 2nd=deko, 3rd=fiko, 4th=goko, 5th=kuko, 6th=lako, 7th=meko, 8th=niko, 9th=poko, 10th=suko, 11th=tako, 12th=xeko. These are known as 'referentials' (short for 'referential pronouns').</p>
<p>In everyday speech the most common of these pairs are <strong>baki</strong>/<strong>bako</strong> (<em>this</em>, or <em>this first one</em>) and <strong>deki</strong>/<strong>deko</strong> (<em>that</em>, or <em>that second one</em>). Less common are <strong>fiki</strong>/<strong>fiko</strong> (<em>that third one</em>) and <strong>goki</strong>/<strong>goko</strong> (<em>that fourth one</em>). It is rare to use any of the other demonstratives. It is usual for the speaker to declare demonstratives in some kind of logical order, such as from left to right when pointing, with the intention of facilitating understanding by the listener.</p>
<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>
<p>You and a friend are looking at 3 trees. You point at each tree in turn, from left to right, while saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(baki, deki na fiki).<br />
<em>This first one, that second one, that third one.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You friend asks you which one you think is tallest. You say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>deko.<br />
<em>That second one.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You friend disagrees by shaking his head and saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bako.<br />
<em>This first one.</em></p>

<h4 id="scope-4">Scope</h4>
<p>To be able to express:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;is a&quot; in the sense of membership or classification</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="means-4">Means</h4>
<p>Use the verb <strong>tuni</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>The verb <strong>tuni</strong> was rolled (that is, randomly generated by rolling dice).</p>
<p>The words <strong>lisusu</strong> (<em>language</em>) and <strong>lefu</strong> (tree) were also rolled.</p>
<p>The more commonly a word root is expected to be used and compounded in everyday speech, the fewer syllables it is given. Here a design decision has been made that a word meaning <em>tree</em> would probably be used more commonly in everyday speech than a word meaning <em>language</em>, hence <strong>lefu</strong> has fewer syllables than <strong>lisusu</strong>. All single-syllable word roots are reserved for the core grammatical words of the Nuda language, such as <strong>na</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>
<p>In general, word order in Nuda is SVO (subject, verb, object):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nuda tuni lisusu.<br />
<em>Nuda is a language.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You point at a tree and say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>baki tuni lefu.<br />
<em>This is a tree.</em><br />
= <em>This first one is a tree.</em><br />
= <em>That is a tree.</em><br />
= <em>That first one is a tree.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your friend agrees by nodding his head and saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bako tuni lefu.<br />
<em>It is a tree.</em><br />
= <em>This is a tree.</em><br />
= <em>This first one is a tree.</em><br />
= <em>That is a tree.</em><br />
= <em>That first one is a tree.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the referential pronoun <strong>bako</strong> refers specifically to the very same thing which was most recently introduced into the conversation as the declarative pronoun <strong>baki</strong>. It is ungrammatical to use a referential pronoun (such as <strong>bako</strong>) whose corresponding declarative pronoun (such as <strong>baki</strong>) has not already been introduced into the conversation.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="means-5">Means</h4>
<p>Use the verb <strong>fa</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="notes-1">Notes</h4>
<p>The verb <strong>fa</strong> was rolled.</p>
<p>The word <strong>nu</strong> means <em>good</em> or <em>desirable</em> and was chosen since it corresponds to the first syllable of <strong>Nuda</strong> and is therefore easy to remember. The word <strong>ka</strong> means <em>opposite</em> and was chosen for its phonetic clarity and ease. Therefore <strong>kanu</strong> means <em>bad</em>.</p>
<h4 id="examples-3">Examples</h4>
<p>You say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nuda fa nu.<br />
<em>Nuda is good.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To explain that you are speaking Nuda you say:</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="means-6">Means</h4>
<p>Use the verb <strong>fi</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="notes-2">Notes</h4>
<p>This verb was chosen logically. The hands of the Nuda clock show the time as being 3 o'clock. The syllable at that position is <strong>fi</strong>. This position on the clock is a reference point from which words, such as mathematical operators, are logically derived relative to the integer 3. The word <strong>fi</strong> is the verb &quot;to equal&quot; (or &quot;is&quot; in the sense of equality) because it is this very reference point.</p>
<h4 id="examples-4">Examples</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Nuda fi Nuda.<br />

<h3 id="s8.-previous-sentence-defu">s8. Previous sentence: defu</h3>
<h4 id="scope-7">Scope</h4>
<p>To be able to refer to the meaning of the previous sentence.</p>
<h4 id="means-7">Means</h4>
<p>Use the referential pronoun <strong>defu</strong>. It can only refer to the meaning of the previous sentence.</p>
<h4 id="notes-3">Notes</h4>
<p>This pronoun was chosen logically. On the Nuda clock, 3 o'clock is the reference point and is thought of as the present. The 2 o'clock syllable <strong>de</strong> is therefore prior to the reference point and here combined with <strong>fu</strong>, a syllable already associated with ordinality since it is the final syllable of all ordinal numbers, implies the general concept of being in the past or previous. However, <strong>defu</strong> is a special pronoun used only to refer to the meaning of the previous sentence. It is never used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>The referential pronoun <strong>defu</strong> is very commonly used.</p>
<p>The word <strong>mi</strong> was rolled. It means <em>true</em>. Thus <strong>kami</strong> means <em>false</em>.</p>
<h4 id="examples-5">Examples</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>1 = 1. defu fa mi.<br />
<em>1 = 1. That is true.</em><br />
= <em>1 = 1. The previous sentence is true.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bana fi bana. defu fa mi.<br />
<em>One equals one. That is true.</em><br />
= <em>One equals one. The previous sentence is true.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 = 2. defu fa kami.<br />
<em>1 = 2. That is false.</em><br />
= <em>1 = 2. The previous sentence is false.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bana fi dena. defu fa kami.<br />
<em>One equals two. That is false.</em><br />
= <em>One equals two. The previous sentence is false.</em></p>

<p>To be able to refer to the meaning of the next sentence.</p>
<h4 id="means-8">Means</h4>
<p>Use the referential pronoun <strong>gofu</strong>. It can only refer to the meaning of the next sentence.</p>
<h4 id="notes-4">Notes</h4>
<p>This pronoun was chosen logically. On the Nuda clock, 3 o'clock is the reference point and is thought of as the present. The 4 o'clock syllable <strong>go</strong> is therefore later than the reference point and here combined with <strong>fu</strong>, a syllable already associated with ordinality since it is the final syllable of all ordinal numbers, implies the general concept of being in the future or next. However, <strong>gofu</strong> is a special pronoun used only to refer to the meaning of the next sentence. It is never used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>The referential pronoun <strong>gofu</strong> is used occasionally.</p>
<h4 id="examples-6">Examples</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>gofu fa mi. 1 = 1.<br />

<h4 id="means-9">Means</h4>
<p>Use the referential pronoun <strong>fifu</strong>. It can only refer to the the present sentence itself; that is, the sentence in which <strong>fifu</strong> occurs. Unlike <strong>defu</strong> and <strong>gofu</strong>, which refer to the <em>meaning expressed by</em> the previous and next sentences respectively, <strong>fifu</strong> refers not to the meaning expressed by the present sentence but merely to the present sentence itself <em>as an entity</em>.</p>
<h4 id="notes-5">Notes</h4>
<p>This pronoun was chosen logically. On the Nuda clock, 3 o'clock is the reference point and is thought of as the present. The 3 o'clock syllable <strong>fi</strong> is therefore here combined with <strong>fu</strong>, a syllable already associated with ordinality since it is the final syllable of all ordinal numbers, implying the general concept of the present or the present reference point. However, <strong>fifu</strong> is a special pronoun used only to refer to the present sentence as an entity. It is never used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>The referential pronoun <strong>fifu</strong> is rarely used.</p>

<p>Follow the subject with a declarative pronoun such as <strong>baki</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="notes-7">Notes</h4>
<p>Nearly always <strong>baki/bako</strong> are used for this purpose unless in the context of the current conversation they are still being used to refer to something else, in which case the speaker would use the next pronoun pair in the ordinal sequence of referential/demonstrative pronoun pairs (<strong>baki/bako</strong>, <strong>deki/deko</strong>, <strong>fiki/fiko</strong> ...).</p>
<h4 id="examples-9">Examples</h4>
<p>By default, the subject of a sentence is specific.</p>
<p>To comment on a specific book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fume fa nu.<br />
<em>The book is good.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here <strong>defu</strong> refers to the meaning of the previous sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fume fa nu. defu fa mi.<br />
<em>The book is good. That is true.</em><br />
= <em>The book is good. The previous sentence is true.</em><br />

<em>This book is good.</em><br />

</blockquote>
<p>Here <strong>defu</strong> refers to the meaning of the previous sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fume baki fa nu. defu fa mi.<br />
<em>This book is good. That is true.</em><br />
= <em>This book is good. The previous sentence is true.</em><br />
= <em>It is true that this book is good.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here <strong>bako</strong> refers to the specific book introduced in the previous sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fume baki fa nu. bako fa mi.<br />
<em>This book is good. It is true.</em><br />
= <em>This book is good. It [the book] is true.</em><br />
= <em>This book is good and true.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most recent use of a declarative pronoun, such as <strong>baki</strong>, supersedes its prior use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fume baki fa nu. lefu baki fa nu. bako fa nu.<br />
<em>This book is good. This tree is good. It [the tree] is good.</em><br />
= <em>This book is good. This tree is good. The tree is good.</em></p>

<em>This tree is good. This book is good. It [the book] is good.</em><br />
= <em>This tree is good. This book is good. The book is good.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid such supersession, use the next pronoun pair (here <strong>deki/deko</strong>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fume baki fa nu. lefu deki fa nu. bako fa nu. deko fa nu.<br />
<em>This book is good. This tree is good. It [the book] is good. It [the tree] is good.</em><br />

<h3 id="s13.-adjectives">s13. Adjectives</h3>
<h4 id="scope-12">Scope</h4>
<p>To be able to qualify a noun by the use of an adjective.</p>
<h4 id="means-12">Means</h4>
<p>For 1 adjective only: immediately follow the noun with the adjective.</p>
<p>It is ungrammatical to follow a noun with more than 1 adjective except by forming a sentence with the verb <strong>fa</strong> followed by a <a href="#s2.-lists">list</a> of adjectives. That is, a noun phrase in itself cannot contain more than 1 adjective.</p>
<h4 id="notes-8">Notes</h4>
<p>The adjective <strong>xeno</strong> means <em>new</em>. It can be converted into a noun by the addition of <strong>-to</strong> so as to mean <em>newness</em> (the degree of being new).</p>
<p>The nouns <strong>defona</strong> and <strong>kadefona</strong> mean <em>fiction</em> and <em>non-fiction</em> respectively. They can be converted into the adjectives <em>fictional</em> (being fiction) and <em>non-fictional</em> (being non-fiction) by the addition of <strong>-ki</strong>.</p>
<p>The final vowel of a word root does not indicate its part of speech. For example: <strong>fume</strong> (<em>book</em>), <strong>lisusu</strong> (<em>language</em>) and <strong>defona</strong> (<em>fiction</em>) are all nouns; <strong>nu</strong> (<em>good</em>), <strong>mi</strong> (<em>true</em>) and <strong>xeno</strong> (<em>new</em>) are all adjectives. You must memorize the meaning of a word root; there is no way to determine the part of speech of a word root from its structure. However, the structure of <strong>xeno-to</strong> (<em>newness</em>) clearly indicates by the presence of the hyphenated suffix <strong>-to</strong> that it is a noun (<strong>xeno-to</strong>) derived from an adjective (<strong>xeno</strong>). Similarly <strong>defona-ki</strong> (<em>fictional</em>) and <strong>kadefona-ki</strong> (<em>non-fictional</em>) are clearly adjectives derived from nouns.</p>
<h4 id="examples-10">Examples</h4>

</ul>
<h4 id="notes-9">Notes</h4>
<p>The <a href="#s3.-singular-demonstratives">demonstratives</a> of Nuda are numerous and powerful, yet they are easy to use since they are essentially just an ordinal series of pairs (<strong>baki/bako</strong>, <strong>deki/deko</strong>, <strong>fiki</strong>/<strong>fiko</strong>, <strong>goki/goko</strong> and so on). Furthermore, Nuda has words like <a href="#s8.-previous-sentence-defu"><em>defu</em></a> and <a href="#s9.-next-sentence-gofu"><em>gofu</em></a> which concisely refer to the meaning of the previous and following sentences respectively. Nuda does not have relative clauses. Instead it has relative sentences. Complex matters should be expressed by relating several short sentences to each other.</p>
<p>It is quite normal to use fragmentary sentences such as the first sentence in <strong>fume baki. bako fa nu.</strong> (<em>This book. It is good.</em>). Indeed, <strong>fume mi baki. bako fa nu.</strong> (<em>This true book. It is good.</em>) is considered better style than <strong>fume mi baki fa nu.</strong> (<em>This true book is good.</em>) because the former is easier to parse and better reinforces the meaning of the demonstrative pair.</p>
