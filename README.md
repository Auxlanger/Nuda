## Introduction

This language is an *a priori* language in which **new word roots are randomly generated using dice**.

For each syllable in a new root:

- a [D12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Standard_variations) is rolled to determine the initial consonant (1=b, 2=d, 3=f, 4=g, 5=k, 6=l, 7=m, 8=n, 9=p, 10=s, 11=t, 12=y)
- a [D6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Standard_variations) is rolled to determine the vowel (1=a, 2=a, 3=i, 4=i, 5=u, 6=u).

The first roll is always used. No re-rolls are permitted. That is, except for proper nouns, the formulation of new word roots must always be entirely random. The name of the language, *Nuda*, was the result of the first four dice rolls in the construction of the language.

The language shall have a **very small, strict grammar**.

The size of the **vocabulary is unlimited** but compounding of existing roots shall be preferred over creating new roots.

Spelling, pronunciation and grammar shall be **simple and easy**.

The language is intended to be **fun and practical**. It is not intended to rival natural languages in power.

## Phonology

One letter, one sound:

- a ≈ /a/ (optionally /ə/ when unstressed)
- b = /b/
- d = /d/
- f = /f/
- g = /g/
- i ≈ /i/
- k = /k/
- l = /l/
- m = /m/
- n = /n/
- p = /p/
- s = /s/
- t = /t/
- u ≈ /u/
- y = /j/

That is:

- Consonants (C): b d f g k l m n p s t y
- Vowels (V): a i u

Syllable structure is:

- CV

Unused letters:

- c e h j o q r v w x z
