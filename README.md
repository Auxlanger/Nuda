## Introduction

This language is an *a priori* language in which **new word roots are randomly generated using dice**.

For each syllable in a new root:

- a [D12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Standard_variations) is rolled to determine the initial consonant (1=b, 2=d, 3=f, 4=g, 5=k, 6=l, 7=m, 8=n, 9=p, 10=s, 11=t, 12=y)
- a [D6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Standard_variations) is rolled to determine the vowel (1=a, 2=a, 3=e, 4=i, 5=o, 6=u).

Except for proper nouns and mnemonic patterns or sequences, the creation of new word roots must always be entirely random by means of dice rolls as shown above. However, a randomly rolled word root can be rejected if for some reason inherent to the language it would be likely to cause problems, cause confusion or be difficult to remember. In that case the entire word root is rolled again.

The name of the language, *Nuda*, was the result of the first four dice rolls in the construction of the language.

The language shall have a **very small, strict grammar**.

The size of the **vocabulary is unlimited** but compounding of existing roots shall be preferred over creating new roots.

Spelling, pronunciation and grammar shall be **simple and easy**.

The language is intended to be **fun and practical**. It is not intended to rival natural languages in power.

## Timeline

20170101 : Start of project  
20170103 : Name of language randomly selected (from **bdfgklmnpsty** and **aiu**): Nuda  
20170104 : Increased vowels from 3 to 5 (now **bdfgklmnpsty** and **aaeiou**) with **a** twice as likely as any other vowel

## Phonology

Almost one letter, one sound. The exceptions are:

1. optionally, **a** can weaken from /a/ to /ə/ when unstressed
2. occasionally, **k** can be pronounced /kw/ to emphasize that is is not **g**
3. occasionally, **p** can be pronounced /pw/ to emphasize that is is not **b**
4. occasionally, **t** can be pronounced /tw/ to emphasize that is is not **d**

Thus:

- **a** ≈ /a/ `(optionally /ə/ when unstressed)`
- **b** = /b/
- **d** = /d/
- **e** ≈ /e/
- **f** = /f/
- **g** = /g/
- **i** ≈ /i/
- **k** = /k/ `(optionally /kw/)`
- **l** = /l/
- **m** = /m/
- **n** = /n/
- **o** ≈ /o/
- **p** = /p/ `(optionally /pw/)`
- **s** = /s/
- **t** = /t/ `(optionally /tw/)`
- **u** ≈ /u/
- **y** = /j/

That is:

- Consonants (C): **b d f g k l m n p s t y**
- Vowels (V): **a e i u o**

Syllable structure is:

- CV

Unused letters:

- c h j q r v w x z
