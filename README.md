## Introduction

This language is an *a priori* language in which **new word roots are randomly generated using dice**.

For each syllable in a new root:

- a [D12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Standard_variations) is rolled to determine the initial consonant (1=b, 2=d, 3=f, 4=g, 5=k, 6=l, 7=m, 8=n, 9=p, 10=s, 11=t, 12=x)
- a [D6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Standard_variations) is rolled to determine the vowel (1=a, 2=a, 3=e, 4=i, 5=o, 6=u).

Except for proper nouns and mnemonic patterns or sequences, the creation of new word roots must always be entirely random by means of dice rolls as shown above. However, a randomly rolled word root can be rejected if for some reason inherent to the language it would be likely to cause problems, cause confusion or be difficult to remember. In that case the entire word root is rolled again.

The name of the language, *Nuda*, was the result of the first four dice rolls in the construction of the language.

The language shall have a **very small, strict grammar**.

The size of the **vocabulary is unlimited** but compounding of existing roots shall be preferred over creating new roots.

Spelling, pronunciation and grammar shall be **simple and easy**.

The language is intended to be **fun and practical**. It is not intended to rival natural languages in power.

## Timeline

20170101 : Start of project  
20170103 : Name of language randomly selected (from **bdfgklmnpsty** and **aiu**): Nuda  
20170104 : Increased vowels from 3 to 5 (now **bdfgklmnpsty** and **aaeiou**) with **a** twice as likely as any other vowel  
20170105 : Replaced **y** with **x** to eliminate accidental diphthongs (now **bdfgklmnpstx** and **aaeiou**)

## Rationale

### Why *a priori*?

Most modern auxlangs are *a posteriori* in the sense that their word roots are taken from existing natural languages. Nuda is an *a priori* language whose word roots are randomly generated by rolling dice. The principal reasons for this design decision were:

- Several well-developed and reasonably well-known *a posteriori* auxlangs are already available (Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, Occidental, Lingua Franca Nova, Lingwa de Planeta). However, for passive literary use in reading sophisticated works of literature, Robert Winter, whose native language is English, found all of these languages to be far more difficult than French. This unexpected conclusion was reached after a few years of intermittent study of these auxlangs and of French. A major factor was that the resources available to assist the student of French were far superior to the resources available for any of the auxlangs. And although it was easier for Robert Winter to write simplistic sentences in the auxlangs than in French, the only auxlang he nearly always found to be easier than French for writing sophisticated sentences without assistance from another person was Interlingua, since it was possible to extrapolate from natural Romance languages to Interlingua when composing sophisticated sentences. However, Interlingua remained far more difficult than French for reading sophisticated works of literature. If a native speaker of English finds that French, although very difficult, is easier to learn to read in depth than any of these *a posteriori* auxlangs, despite their familiar vocabulary, it is even more likely that a native speaker of Chinese, to whom their vocabulary is unfamiliar, would reach the same conclusion. In other words, the use of *a posteriori* vocabulary as the basis of an auxlang typically brings with it such difficulty (in idioms, grammar, word formation, pronunciation, phonotactics and spelling) that the auxlang is then unable to compete with the natural languages from which its vocabulary is sourced. One might as well just learn English instead.

## Phonology

Almost one letter, one phoneme. The exceptions are:

1. optionally, **a** can weaken from /a/ to /ə/ when unstressed
2. occasionally, **k** can be pronounced /kw/ to emphasize that it is not **g**
3. occasionally, **p** can be pronounced /pw/ to emphasize that it is not **b**
4. occasionally, **t** can be pronounced /tw/ to emphasize that it is not **d**

Thus:

- **a** ≈ /a/ `(optionally /ə/ when unstressed)`
- **b** = /b/
- **d** = /d/
- **e** ≈ /e/
- **f** = /f/
- **g** = /g/
- **i** ≈ /i/
- **k** = /k/ `(optionally /kw/)`
- **l** = /l/
- **m** = /m/
- **n** = /n/
- **o** ≈ /o/
- **p** = /p/ `(optionally /pw/)`
- **s** = /s/
- **t** = /t/ `(optionally /tw/)`
- **u** ≈ /u/
- **x** ≈ /ʃ/

That is:

- Consonants (C): **b d f g k l m n p s t x**
- Vowels (V): **a e i u o**

Syllable structure is:

- CV

Unused letters:

- c h j q r v w y z
